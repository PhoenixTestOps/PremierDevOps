This framework provides the capability to create and execute business facing tests using the BDD software development process. It provides a wrapper around [Serenity](http://www.thucydides.info), a BDD open source library. The key features provided are:

1. Tests can be written in feature files using the "Given, When, Then" structure (by using Gherkin, which is the name of Cucumber's DSL).
2. JIRA ID's can be mapped to feature files to allow links to be created within the report generated by Serenity.
3. Feature coverage can be easily viewed if your JIRA project is catgeorised into epics and links.
4. The status of a JIRA story can be updated, depending on the outcome of the tests.

## Configuration
Once you have cloned the [qa-framework/bdd-acceptance-test](https://gitlab.com/qa-framework/bdd-acceptance-test) repo locally, the following updates will be required in the project:

### serenity.properties
`serenity.properties` lives in the root directory of your project. It is required in order to configure a number of property values that Serenity requires in order to execute tests and integrate with jira.

Comments have been provided in the file to help you understand the purpose of the property. The entire list of properties can be found [here](http://serenity-bdd.info/docs/serenity/#_serenity_system_properties_and_configuration)
