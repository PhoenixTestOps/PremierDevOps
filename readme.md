Working Acceptance Test for PremierDevOps
===================

## Pre-requisistes

1. Maven is installed and the environment variable set (From the command line run "mvn -v")
2. Java is installed and the environment variable set (From the command line run "java -version")
3. Git is installed and the environment variable set (From the command line run "git --version")


This framework provides the capability to create and execute business facing tests using the BDD software development process. It provides a wrapper around [Serenity](http://www.thucydides.info), a BDD open source library. The key features provided are:


1. Tests can be written in feature files using the "Given, When, Then" structure (by using Gherkin, which is the name of Cucumber's DSL).
2. JIRA ID's can be mapped to feature files to allow links to be created within the report generated by Serenity (Must be configured in your pom.xml)
3. Feature coverage can be easily viewed if your JIRA project is categorised into epics and links (Must be configured in your pom.xml).
4. The status of a JIRA story can be updated, depending on the outcome of the tests (Must be configured in your POM.xml).
5. Webdriver support using [Serenity Page Objects](http://serenity-bdd.info/docs/serenity/#_writing_serenity_page_objects)
6. Testing REST services using [Rest Assured](http://serenity-bdd.info/docs/serenity/#_testing_rest_with_serenity_bdd)


Configuration
-------------
1. Clone project 

Usage
-----

The framework is divided as follows:

| Folder             | Description           |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
  src/main/java      | Application sources
  src/main/resources | Application resources
  src/test/java      | Step definitions
  src/test/resources | Test resources and Feature files


Examples have been provided within the framework to help build your understanding.

The tests can be executed in a number of ways in Maven:

| Command																| Description           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
  `mvn clean verify`													| Run all features
  `mvn clean verify -Denv=local`									| Run all features and pass in an environment file
  `mvn clean verify -Dit.test=Feature01IT`						| Run a single feature
  `mvn failsafe:integration-test -Dit.test=Belly01IT`			| Run a single scenario, but without recompiling the code
  `mvn clean verify -Dcucumber.options="--tags @regression"`	| Run scenarios with a specific tag
  `mvn clean verify -Dit.test=Belly01IT` | Run a single test by compiling the code 
  `mvn failsafe:integration-test -Dit.test=Belly01IT` | Run a single test from compiled sources

Reports
-------
Once you have executed the tests, Serenity will create reports under the `target/site/serenity/index.html`. Here you can view the test execution status and requirements coverage (if configured in pom.xml).

Code coverage metrics can be found under `target/site/jacoco/index.html`.
