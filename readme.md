This framework provides the capability to create and execute business facing tests using the BDD software development process. The framework provides a wrapper around [Serenity](http://www.thucydides.info), a BDD open source library. The key features provided are:

1. Tests can be written in feature files using the "Given, When, Then" structure (by using Gherkin, which is the name of Cucumber's DSL).
2. JIRA ID's can be mapped to feature files to allow links to be created within the report generated by Serenity.
3. Feature coverage can be easily viewed if your JIRA project is catgeorised into epics and links.
4. The status of a JIRA story can be updated, depending on the outcome of the tests.
